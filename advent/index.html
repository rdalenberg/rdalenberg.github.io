Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.

<P>
I have been hunting for, collecting and comparing versions of Adventure
since the late 1970s.  While development of new versions has certainly
showed down since then, it has not completely stopped.
</P>

<P>
I differentiate between "game versions", which differ
by changes in rooms/puzzles/treasures/etc within the game,
and "code versions" which differ by programming changes for a new computer 
architecture, or an existing game being rewritten in a new language.
